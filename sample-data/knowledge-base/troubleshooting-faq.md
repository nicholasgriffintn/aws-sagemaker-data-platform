**A:** Common solutions:
1. Check that your execution role has permissions to read from S3 buckets
2. Verify Athena workgroup configuration and result location
3. Ensure the Glue database and tables exist
4. Confirm S3 bucket policies allow query result writes

#### Q: Data is not appearing in Unified Studio
**A:** Troubleshooting steps:
1. Refresh the data catalog in Unified Studio
2. Check that tables are properly registered in Glue
3. Verify IAM roles have necessary permissions
4. Ensure VPC configuration allows access to services

### ETL and Processing Issues

#### Q: Glue ETL job is failing
**A:** Debug checklist:
1. Review CloudWatch logs for specific error messages
2. Check input data format and schema compatibility
3. Verify sufficient resources allocated for the job
4. Ensure output S3 location has write permissions
5. Validate Glue job parameters and arguments

#### Q: ETL job runs slowly or times out
**A:** Performance optimization:
1. Increase DPU allocation for the job
2. Optimize data partitioning strategy
3. Use appropriate file formats (Parquet vs CSV)
4. Consider breaking large jobs into smaller chunks
5. Review and optimize transformation logic

#### Q: Data quality issues in processed datasets
**A:** Quality assurance steps:
1. Implement data validation checks in ETL scripts
2. Add logging for transformation steps
3. Compare row counts before and after processing
4. Validate key business metrics and constraints
5. Set up data quality monitoring alerts

### SageMaker and ML Issues

#### Q: Training jobs fail to start
**A:** Common causes and fixes:
1. Check IAM execution role permissions
2. Verify training data location and format
3. Ensure sufficient service quotas and limits
4. Validate training script and dependencies
5. Check VPC and security group configuration

#### Q: Model deployment endpoint creation fails
**A:** Deployment troubleshooting:
1. Verify model artifacts are properly stored in S3
2. Check endpoint configuration and instance types
3. Ensure IAM role has model deployment permissions
4. Validate model serving code and dependencies
5. Review CloudWatch logs for specific errors

#### Q: Notebook instances won't start
**A:** Instance startup issues:
1. Check service quotas for notebook instances
2. Verify IAM role configuration
3. Ensure VPC and subnet configuration is correct
4. Check for any resource conflicts or limits
5. Try different instance types or regions

### Bedrock and AI Issues

#### Q: Knowledge Base queries return no results
**A:** Knowledge Base troubleshooting:
1. Verify documents are properly uploaded to S3
2. Check that data source synchronization completed
3. Ensure embedding model is properly configured
4. Test with simpler queries to verify functionality
5. Review OpenSearch Serverless collection status

#### Q: Foundation model access denied errors
**A:** Model access solutions:
1. Verify Bedrock service permissions in IAM role
2. Check that requested models are available in your region
3. Ensure model access has been granted in Bedrock console
4. Validate API request format and parameters
5. Review service quotas and rate limits

#### Q: Guardrails blocking legitimate content
**A:** Guardrail configuration:
1. Review guardrail policy configuration
2. Adjust content filtering sensitivity levels
3. Add appropriate topic exemptions if needed
4. Test with different content variations
5. Consider custom guardrail configurations

### Performance and Cost Issues

#### Q: Unexpected high costs
**A:** Cost optimization review:
1. Monitor resource usage in Cost Explorer
2. Check for idle or unused resources
3. Review data storage lifecycle policies
4. Optimize compute instance types and sizes
5. Implement automated resource cleanup

#### Q: Slow query performance in Athena
**A:** Query optimization:
1. Use columnar formats like Parquet
2. Implement proper data partitioning
3. Use LIMIT clauses for exploratory queries
4. Optimize JOIN operations and query structure
5. Consider query result caching

#### Q: Long ETL processing times
**A:** Processing optimization:
1. Increase Glue job DPU allocation
2. Optimize data transformation logic
3. Use appropriate data formats and compression
4. Consider parallel processing strategies
5. Profile job performance and identify bottlenecks

### Network and Security Issues

#### Q: VPC connectivity problems
**A:** Network troubleshooting:
1. Check VPC endpoint configurations
2. Verify security group rules allow necessary traffic
3. Ensure NAT Gateway configuration for private subnets
4. Review route tables and network ACLs
5. Test connectivity using VPC Reachability Analyzer

#### Q: SSL/TLS certificate errors
**A:** Certificate issues:
1. Verify certificate validity and expiration
2. Check certificate chain completeness
3. Ensure proper certificate installation
4. Review SSL/TLS configuration settings
5. Test with updated certificate bundles
