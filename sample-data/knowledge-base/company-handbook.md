# Company Data Platform Handbook

## Overview

Welcome to our comprehensive data platform built on AWS SageMaker Unified Studio. This document provides essential information about our data infrastructure, processes, and best practices.

## Data Platform Architecture

### Core Components

Our data platform consists of several integrated AWS services:

- **Amazon S3**: Data lake storage with separate buckets for raw, curated, and project data
- **AWS Glue**: Data catalog and ETL processing for schema discovery and data transformation
- **Amazon Athena**: SQL analytics engine for querying data across our data lake
- **Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio**: Unified development environment for data science and analytics
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Generative AI capabilities with knowledge bases and guardrails

### Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data is uploaded to S3 raw bucket from various sources
2. **Schema Discovery**: Glue crawlers automatically discover and catalog data schemas
3. **Data Processing**: ETL jobs transform raw data into curated, analysis-ready datasets
4. **Analytics**: Data scientists and analysts query processed data using Athena and Unified Studio
5. **AI/ML**: Machine learning models are trained and deployed using SageMaker capabilities

## Data Governance

### Data Classification

- **Raw Data**: Unprocessed data from source systems
- **Curated Data**: Cleaned and transformed data ready for analysis
- **Project Data**: Artifacts, models, and outputs from data science projects

### Access Control

Access to data is controlled through IAM roles and policies:
- Data Engineers: Full access to ETL processes and data transformation
- Data Scientists: Read access to curated data, full access to project workspace
- Business Analysts: Read access to approved datasets through Athena

### Data Quality Standards

All data must meet our quality standards:
- Completeness: No critical fields should be null
- Accuracy: Data should be validated against business rules
- Consistency: Data formats should be standardized across sources
- Timeliness: Data should be processed within agreed SLAs

## Best Practices

### Data Processing

1. Always validate data quality before processing
2. Use partitioning for large datasets to improve query performance
3. Document all transformations and business logic
4. Implement proper error handling and logging

### Security

1. Use least privilege access principles
2. Encrypt data at rest and in transit
3. Regularly audit access patterns
4. Follow data retention policies

### Performance Optimization

1. Use appropriate file formats (Parquet for analytics)
2. Implement proper partitioning strategies
3. Optimize Glue job parameters for your workload
4. Monitor costs and usage patterns

## Support and Contact
