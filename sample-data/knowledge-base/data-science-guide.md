# Data Science Guide

## Introduction to SageMaker Unified Studio

Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio provides a comprehensive environment for data science and machine learning workflows. This guide covers the essential concepts and practices for working within our platform.

## Getting Started with Unified Studio

### Creating Your First Project

1. **Access Unified Studio**: Navigate to the SageMaker console and open your domain
2. **Create Project**: Click "Create Project" and choose a template
3. **Set Permissions**: Configure project permissions and team access
4. **Initialize Workspace**: Set up your development environment

### Working with Data

#### Data Discovery

Use the built-in data catalog to explore available datasets:
- Browse tables in the Glue Data Catalog
- Preview data samples directly in the interface
- Check data lineage and metadata
- Review data quality metrics

#### Data Access Patterns

```python
# Example: Reading data in a Unified Studio notebook
import pandas as pd
import boto3

# Query data using Athena
athena_client = boto3.client('athena')
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

query = """
SELECT customer_segment, 
       AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value,
       COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM "dev-data-catalog"."sales" 
GROUP BY customer_segment
"""

# Execute query and retrieve results
# (Implementation details would be in actual notebook)
```

## Machine Learning Workflows

### Model Development Lifecycle

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Feature engineering using built-in tools
   - Data validation and quality checks
   - Train/validation/test splits

2. **Model Training**
   - Use SageMaker training jobs for scalable training
   - Experiment tracking with SageMaker Experiments
   - Hyperparameter tuning with automatic optimization

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Model performance metrics
   - Bias detection and fairness analysis
   - Model interpretability reports

4. **Model Deployment**
   - Real-time endpoints for low-latency inference
   - Batch transform jobs for bulk predictions
   - Multi-model endpoints for cost optimization

### Best Practices for ML Projects

#### Experiment Management
- Use descriptive experiment names and tags
- Track all hyperparameters and metrics
- Document model assumptions and limitations
- Version control your code and data

#### Feature Engineering
- Create reusable feature transformations
- Document feature definitions and business logic
- Validate feature distributions across time periods
- Monitor feature drift in production

#### Model Monitoring
- Set up automated model quality monitoring
- Track prediction accuracy over time
- Monitor for data drift and concept drift
- Implement automated retraining triggers

## Generative AI with Bedrock

### Knowledge Base Integration

Our platform includes a Bedrock Knowledge Base for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):

```python
# Example: Using Bedrock for document Q&A
import boto3

bedrock_client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
bedrock_agent_client = boto3.client('bedrock-agent-runtime')

# Query the knowledge base
response = bedrock_agent_client.retrieve(
    knowledgeBaseId='your-kb-id',
    retrievalQuery={
        'text': 'What are the data quality standards?'
    }
)

# Process retrieved documents
for result in response['retrievalResults']:
    print(f"Score: {result['score']}")
    print(f"Content: {result['content']['text']}")
```

### Foundation Model Usage

Access to various foundation models for different use cases:
- **Text Generation**: Content creation, summarization, code generation
- **Text Embedding**: Semantic search, document similarity
- **Code Generation**: Automated code completion and optimization

### Guardrails and Safety

Our platform implements content filtering and safety measures:
- Inappropriate content detection
- Prompt injection protection
- Topic-based filtering
- Output monitoring and logging

## Collaboration Features

### Project Sharing

- Share notebooks and experiments with team members
- Collaborative editing and commenting
- Version control integration
- Access control at project level

### Artifact Management

- Model registry for versioning and deployment
- Dataset versioning and lineage tracking
- Experiment result sharing
- Documentation templates

## Performance and Cost Optimization

### Resource Management

- Use appropriate instance types for your workload
- Implement auto-scaling for training jobs
- Monitor resource utilization and costs
- Use spot instances for cost-sensitive workloads

### Data Storage Optimization

- Use appropriate storage classes for different data types
- Implement data lifecycle policies
- Optimize file formats and compression
- Monitor storage costs and usage patterns

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Data Access Problems
- Check IAM permissions and roles
- Verify S3 bucket policies
- Confirm VPC and security group settings

### Training Job Failures
- Review CloudWatch logs for error messages
- Check resource limits and quotas
- Validate input data format and location

### Performance Issues
- Profile your code for bottlenecks
- Optimize data loading and preprocessing
- Consider distributed training for large models
